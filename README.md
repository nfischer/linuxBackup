backup
======

A simple backup script for linux (and other unix derivatives) computers.

Compatibility
-------------
This bash script should be compatible over Linux and Mac. It may also
be compatible over other BSD and unix derivatives. This is tested on
Linux mainly. I have also done limited testing on Mac. No testing has
been done on other systems.
